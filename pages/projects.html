				This project was for the Computer Systems Class (ECE 391). The course introduced us to the concepts and abstractions central to the development of modern computing systems, with an emphasis on the systems software that controls interaction between devices and other hardware and application programs. We covered input-output semantics, synchronization, interrupts, multitasking, virtualization of resources, protection, and resource management concepts. We were also introduced to network and storage device abstractions. In terms of practical skills, we were exposed to software development tools for source control, debugging, dependency management, and compilation, and were also focused in the context of a real operating system executing in a virtual machine. We also developed software analysis skills as well as team-based development and testing skills.<br><br>

				The list of topics includes:
				<ul>
					<li> x86 assembly: review of basic constructs and structures, interfacing C to assembly, macros, stack frame and calling convention</li>
					
					<li>system software basics: resource management, virtualization, protection, system call interface, asynchronous and synchronous interactions</li>
					
					<li>simple data structures: queues, heaps, stacks, lists</li>
				
					<li>interrupts and exceptions: controlling generation and handling, chaining, cleanup code, interactions with device functionality, interrupt controllers</li>

					<li>synchronization: primitives, memory semantics, mutual exclusion, semaphores, scheduling, race conditions</li>

					<li>virtualization of the CPU: processes and scheduling</li>

					<li>I/O interface: file descriptors, buffering, control operations</li>

					<li>device programming: basic abstractions, character and block devices, device driver development process</li>

					<li>user-level programming interfaces for file and network I/O, relationship to kernel I/O abstractions</li>

					<li>virtualization of memory: hardware support and software abstractions</li>

					<li>signals: semantics, generation, and delivery</li>

					<li>file system abstractions and disk layout</li>
				</ul>

				To tie the concepts of logic gates, transistors, PWM (Pulse Width Modulator) and basic circuitry together and with the expertise gained in the labs we designed a circuit that guides a vehicle along a white piece of tape on a black table - a line-following robot. There were, of course, many difficulties to challenge us - all kinds of turns from gentle curves to 90 degree turns, zig-zags,stopping functionality,color detection and Y-splits. This lab that included the Final design challenge was very enjoyable for me and my lab partner and we saw how our circuitry and theoretical ideas translated in the practical effective motion of the vehicle. <br><br>

				The purpose of this design project is to make a battery powered car follow a taped track on the table. This task is achieved by circuiting a proto board connected to a certain amount of sensors that can detect the tape. The car has to conquer a tape track that consists of zig-zags, curves, right-angle turns, and splits that require a detection of color so that the car chooses the right path. Therefore the task is to try to circuit the board to conquer all the characteristics of the track in one go. <br><br>

				The building of the autonomous vehicle taught us a lot of things. The things that look complicated in functioning may not be that complicated under the hood. The circuitry for our vehicle was very basic yet it completed the track. We also thought about this work used in an industrial environment where such vehicles with more features are used in factories in moving stuff from one area to another autonomously.

<p>
Coffee, Ice and everything Nice <br>
These were the ingredients chosen <br>
To create the perfect little All-Nighter <br>
But my semester time-table accidentally <br>
Added an extra ingredient to the concoction.... <br>
Anthropology <br>
Thus, Chaos was born <br>
Using its anthropological powers <br>
Archaeology, Artifacts, and Eco-facts <br>
Have dedicated their lives to ruin my night <br>
And my sleep.

I admit its a bit weird starting like this. Yes I did watch Power-Puff Girls when I was a kid and to be really honest it was a really good show. Certainly better than what is shown on Cartoon Network these days. But in all seriousness I have been awake for more than 24 hours now. Maybe its because of life in college or I slacked off earlier or maybe because I just hate Anthropology. Well I dont really hate Anthropology but I surely do hate ANTH 101. As a kid I loved Alan Grant from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3">The Jurassic Park</a> and oh my god who can forget <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/">Indiana Jones</a>? What I'm trying to say is that I was into Dinosaurs and Archaeology as a kid. Whenever I visited a park as a kid I would always be digging. My parents or friends were always confused by that and my answer to their confusion always was "I'm digging for Dino Bones!".

As a college student one day I was browsing the course catalog for my University and I stumbled upon a course called "Introduction to Anthropology". First thing that popped in my mind was "Whoa...Dinosaurs!". Ok I know Anthropology is not all about Dinosaurs, I'm not that naive. So I read reviews about the course and planned to take it mainly because it was an easy 'A' class and who knows I could actually bring that childhood interest back (note: I still and forever will love Dinosaurs). Well... I was wrong. The class is actually quite boring. I mean its an introduction class to Anthropology. Shouldn't the course include cool stuff to get students interested in Anthropology? It just didn't work for me. Adding to the misery we don't discuss any dinosaurs in the course and the class starts at 8:00AM in the morning.

So basically I had my second exam for the subject a little more than couple of hours ago. I pulled of an all-nighter to study up for the exam and to some extent I succeeded. I mean I covered everything for the exam and the exam went ok but I'm just too tired now. This entire week has actually been really hectic with all my machine problems and assignments and blah and blah. Basically I finished all my chores and assignments and exam preparations. I can finally sleep in peace tonight.

		//But if we have a lot of 'dt's then the event listener will be called
		//a lot of times which is not good performance-wise. Therefore we added a new

		//parent (dl) only if the 'mouseenter' is on 'some' particular child ONLY. In this
		//case it is dt.
